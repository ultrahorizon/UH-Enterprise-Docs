Deleting Groups
===============

Groups can only be deleted by contacting Ultra Horizon. Simply email our `engineering department`_
and your request will be actioned.

**Deleting a group removes all servers, people and devices. It is a destructive action that
cannot be undone.**

Any subscriptions tied to a deleted group will immediately cancel and a final bill will be
taken at the end of the billing period.
