UH VPN is becoming Enterprise-only
==================================

As of 2020-11-27, UH VPN will no longer be available to new users as we are
switching to focus exclusively on our Enterprise customers.  Current customers
will all be notified by email shortly after this post is made live.

But why?
--------

Since launch, UH VPN has grown rapidly.  We've created bespoke custom brandable
native applications for all major platforms, created custom images for AWS and
Digital Ocean making setting up our server package extremely simple and easy,
and created a specialised DPI evasion engine to increase our connectivity in
regions with internet censorship.

We want to make sure that our customers get the best possible experience with UH
VPN, and we know that the best way to do this is through our Enterprise plan.
We've seen significant interest and growth in this area, and as a result have
decided to focus all of our developmental resources towards that so we can
continue to deliver the high quality product we have always sought to create.

What will happen to my current UH VPN workflow?
-----------------------------------------------

We are still committed to your security, and want to make this move as painless
as possible for those that have embraced UH VPN into their current workflows.
Therefore, current users of UH VPN will continue to be able to use the service;
**all current groups will continue to be fully functional and fully available**
as they exist now.  This means that:

- All current users will be able to log into the UH VPN management console and
  manage their current groups.
- All UH VPN apps and server packages will continue to be freely available and
  receive security updates.
- All VPN connections will continue to work as they have done until now.
- All features available to your current group tier will continue to be
  available.
  
  - Free Groups will still be able to add and remove a single device for free.
  - Premium Groups will still be able to add and remove devices, and will be
    billed as normal (Â£1 GBP ex VAT per device).

- Our public issue tracker will remain online and we will continue responding to
  any reports/feature requests made there.

What is changing?
-----------------

We wouldn't be writing this post if there weren't any changes.  Specifically the
following will change:

- Current users will not be able to create new Groups.
- Current Free-tier Groups will not be able to upgrade to become Premium-tier.
- New users will not be able to sign up to UH VPN.

**Please note that this means that if you delete or downgrade your current
Group, you will not be able to recreate or upgrade it.**

What will happen in the future?
-------------------------------

UH VPN is not going away any time soon!  We will continue to work hard on UH VPN
for our Enterprise clients, bringing in new functionality, state of the art
features and even greater support packages.

**If you are interested in an Enterprise license, please get in touch with
sales@ultra-horizon.com.**

We will revisit the status of UH VPN over the course of 2021, and the `uh-vpn.com`_
website will be updated and current customers will hear from us if we reopen
sign-ups.
